# Introduction to Jest

This project provides a set of examples to demonstrate how to use Jest for testing in JavaScript. Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you're in the `03-jest` directory, and then run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install Jest and any other necessary dependencies.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run all the tests defined in `functions.test.js` and display the results in your terminal.

## Writing Tests

A basic Jest test case is structured as follows:

```js
test("description of the test case", () => {
  expect(someFunction()).toBe(someExpectedValue);
});
```

In `functions.test.js`, you'll find examples of various Jest matchers like `toBe`, `toEqual`, `toBeFalsy`, `toBeTruthy`, and more.
