# Mini Testing Library

This project is a step-by-step demonstration of creating our own mini testing library in JavaScript. The goal is to understand how testing libraries like Jest work and the principles behind them.

## Files

- **test1.js**: Shows basic manual testing without any abstraction.
- **test2.js**: Introduces a reusable `test` function to organize and run tests.
- **test3.js**: Adds an `expect` function with assertions for more readable tests.

## Usage

To run each file and see the tests in action, use Node.js:

```bash
node test1.js
node test2.js
node test3.js
```

## Concepts Covered

- Writing basic tests manually.
- Creating a reusable test function to run tests.
- Using assertions to make tests more readable and expressive.
