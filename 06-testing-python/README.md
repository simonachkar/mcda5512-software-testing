# Python Unit Testing Example

This is a simple example project demonstrating how to write unit tests in Python using the `unittest` framework.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Running the Tests

Run the tests using:

```bash
python -m unittest test_app.py
```

Alternatively, if you have multiple test files, you can run all tests in the directory using:

```bash
python -m unittest
```

## Running the Application

Navigate to the project directory (`06-testing-python`), run the application using:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Additional Information

- Depending on your system's configuration, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python` in the commands
- For more information on the unittest framework, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
